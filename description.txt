Have you ever felt that vanilla's world generation was somewhat bland, because it always generates the same types of chests for all biomes? Well, worry no more!
Chest Type Variety is a mod that does what it says on the tin- it replaces a handful of chest types with relevant alternatives based on the biome the chest generated in. This only works on mods generated after the mod is enabled, though.
The following chest types are affected by this mod:
Wooden Chest -> Ebonwood Chest (Corruption)/Shadewood Chest (Crimson)/Boreal Wood Chest (Snow)/Rich Mahogany Chest or Bamboo Chest (Jungle, 50% chance for either)/Bone Chest (Dungeon)/Pumpkin Chest (Halloween, 10% chance)
Gold Chest -> Lesion Chest (Corruption)/Flesh Chest (Crimson)/Obsidian Chest (Caverns layer, 25% chance)/Golden Chest (Pyramids)
Locked Gold Chest -> Locked Dungeon Chest (color matches with dungeon's color)
Web-Covered Chest -> Spider Chest (5% chance)
Water Chest -> Reef Chest (5% chance)

Additionally, this mod tries to replace Gold Chests that generate out in the open in Glowing Mushroom, Granite, or Marble biomes with the biome's respective chest, and there is a 1% chance on the Celebrationmk10 seed that any chest may be replaced by a Balloon Chest.
If playing with the "lite" config setting enabled (introduced in version 1.1.0), only Wooden Chests outside of the dungeon are replaced. As a result, Shimmer recipes are left unchanged.

Note that (aside from the Mushroom/Granite/Marble chests) these changes are purely visual. The actual contents of the chests are not modified by this mod.
To avoid exploits that allow players to obtain items early, several chests were given restrictions on when they can be decrafted using Shimmer when the "lite" config setting is not enabled:
* Obsidian Chests cannot be decrafted until the world's evil boss is defeated
* Bone Chests cannot be decrafted until Skeletron is defeated
* Spider Chests cannot be decrafted until Hardmode
